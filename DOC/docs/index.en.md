# TINYAUTON

![cover](cover.jpg)

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This project dedicates to the development of a library for tiny agent related computing running on MCU devices to serve the multi-agent systemï¼Œcovering mathematical operations, digital signal processing, and TinyML. 

!!! info "About the Name"
    The name "TinyAuton" is a combination of "Tiny" and "Auton". "Tiny" means the agent is designed to run on MCU devices, and "Auton" is short for "Autonomous Agent".

## TARGET HARDWARE
